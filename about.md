# HTNW Documents
This is the documents site for the [Heritage Trust for the North West (HTNW)](https://heritagetrustnorthwest.org/about/). 
The site is hosted for free on [GitHub](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/GitHub) [Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) (Thank you!). 
Documentation is added as [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  
The documentation can be easily versioned, using GitHub, and it can be viewed in other websites in an [iFrame](https://techterms.com/definition/iframe).  
Viewing in other websites is the reason we went for this method, rather than Google Docs, or Google Sites. They don't allow viewing of their sites, embedded within another.
