# Pendle Heritage Centre
Welcome to the Pendle Heritage Centre, at Park Hill.  

Park Hill has a long history, beginning around 1450, when John Bannister built a timber hall and farm here. During its restoration, Park Hill revealed a trail of evidence telling the story of its development over nearly 600 years, as its owners' fortunes waxed and waned.

This tour will take you to a part of the house which has been left to expose this history as clues, found in the building's fabric.
