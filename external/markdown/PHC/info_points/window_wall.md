# Windows
These windows tell a story - see how they are on odd levels. One set is even blocked up. 
During the 1600s people were taxed on the number of windows they had - many households bricked them up to avoid it - but it doesn't seem to be the case here. This part of the building was extensively modified in the 1700s. They literally raised the roof - by a few feet - and replaced their old mullion windows with fashionable sash windows, instead.
