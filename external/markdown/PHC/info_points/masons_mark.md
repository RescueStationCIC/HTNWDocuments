# Mason's Mark

Masons worked in stone. 
This Mason's Mark is on the outside of the first stone building added to Park Hill, around 1590. 
The building was added to the original timber-framed hall which hasn't survived. In this period, building in timber was becoming quite rare; all the local trees large enough to provide building materials had been felled.

Mason's marks have been difficult for historians to understand; there is very little written down about them and how they were used. They definitely had 3 main uses - Quarry Marks, cut into the stone where it was first cut, to show where it was to be shipped to; Assembly Marks, which are often repeated on similar blocks in a larger peice, so it's obvious how they go together; and Banker Marks, made by the most senior masons who cut the quarried stone into regular blocks, or even sculptures.

Generally, it's accepted that mason's marks are there for entirely practical reasons, rather than, say, an individual mason signing their work.
