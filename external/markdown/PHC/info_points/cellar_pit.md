# Cellar Pit

Cellars have been used since the 1700's to preserve food - they're nice and cool; dry, if properly ventilated.
The walkway, here, takes you over the cellar pit. It was dug into the ground floor in the 1800s. You can still see the old fire-place in the corner.  
Once dug, there's no evidence that the floor was ever put back, so the fireplace would be halfway up the wall.
