# Turnpike Bridge

Built in 1807, the Turnpike Bridge was intended to take the greater loads and vehicles supplying the new cotton industry of Barrowford. It superceded the packhorse bridge a little way upstream, which had been in use since the 1500s. Turnpikes were private toll roads; you can find the old toll house a little further into town, past the mill. 

As the mill was built in 1824, the turnpike road was doing good business and goods could be taken by wagon along it to the towns of Skipton and Clitheroe.   
The canal was just a half-mile away, at Barrowford and was already providing a link to Manchester, but also Blackburn, Leeds and Liverpool.    
From 1849 the East Lancashire Railway could be reached from nearby Colne, with connections to Blackburn, Preston, Manchester and Liverpool.  
But Christopher Grimshaw (owner of the mill at this time) liked to ride his horse to meetings in Manchester every week.
