# Turnpike Bridge

Built in 1807, the Turnpike Bridge was intended to take the greater loads and vehicles supplying the new cotton industry of Barrowford. It superceded the packhorse bridge a little way upstream, which had been in use since the 1500s.

Originally, this bridge had no walls. They were finally added over 50 years later!
