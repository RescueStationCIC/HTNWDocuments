# Chimney


The chimney is carved with the year of its build; 1832. It's 80ft tall and square in cross-section, as all early chimneys were; later ones are round. It sits on top of the hill - which doubles its effective height - and is connected to the mill's boilers by an underground flue.

This was the first local mill to get an engine. At the time all the other mills in the area were water powered. The engine would have provided extra power for mill's looms, in addition to its waterwheel. It also governed speed. Keeping the looms' speed constant was important for the quality of the final fabric and the water wheel could be unreliable in times of low water.

The mill has had many engines over the course of its life; 1832 saw the first - a beam engine - which was upgraded several times, before a tandem engine was installed in a new boiler house in 1889.  It powered nearly 500 looms, weaving fabric every day until 1934. It did more, too, but not at Higherford. The Great Depression caused the mill to close for two years, and when it re-opened in 1936, the engine had been sold, just to keep the company alive.

Two Sentinel Diesel generators replaced the steam engine and, again, Higherford Mill was first. It had converted to Diesel-electric power, years before any other in the area.
