Way back at the beginning of the 1800s, there was an orchard here. There was no mill and no bridge. There were 2 sets of houses, either side of the trees, where the handloomers lived, part of a community of hundreds of weavers working at home, weaving cloth for the Grimshaw family business.
Up river was the packhorse bridge, there since the 1500s, supplying the town's trade from the turnpike road, and the handloomers with their cotton.
1807, a new bridge was built to handle more trade. 
The orchard was in a prime spot and Grimshaw decided to build a mill, right there, spinning quality yarn for the handloomers with cotton coming in from the turnpike trade and Pendle Water, the river, driving a waterwheel for power.
By 1824 the mill was up and running!
