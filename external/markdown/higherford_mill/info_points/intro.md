# Higherford Mill

**Way back at the beginning of the 1800s, there was no mill and no bridge here, just an orchard.**  

Handloom weavers lived in the houses on either side of the fruit trees. These people were part of a community of hundreds of weavers working at home, weaving cloth for the Grimshaw family business.  

Up river was the Packhorse Bridge, which these workers used to cross the river in all weathers. It also supplied their employers with cotton, keeping their trade alive. The new Turnpike Bridge in front of you was built in 1807 as this trade boomed.  

Grimshawâ€™s orchard was in a prime spot beside the river, Pendle Water. So he decided to build a mill right here. His plan - to spin quality yarn for the handloom workers with cotton brought in along the turnpike road. The river was to provide the power needed by driving a waterwheel. By 1824 the mill was up and running.
