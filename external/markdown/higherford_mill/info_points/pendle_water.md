# Pendle Water

The river - Pendle Water - provided power for the mill's waterwheel, via a man-made branch just a little way upstream from here.
 
The branch also fills a lake, called the mill 'lodge'. The lodge provided water which could boost power when the river was low. It would be  allowed to fill up over-night.

The channels bringing water into the mill are called 'leats'.  

A 'pen-trough' - a cast iron channel running running underneath the mill - funnels the water to the right  shape to hit the waterwheel.

The mill is unique in that it has a double-decker pen trough. One for the leat from the river, one for the leat from the lodge.

Finally, the spent water returns to the river, via an outlet underneath the bridge.
