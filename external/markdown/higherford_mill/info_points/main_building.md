# Main Building

This part of the mill was built around 1856 as a 3 storey warehouse, to support the weaving shed next door, to the right.

It also housed the offices, dealt with inspection and despatch of the final product.

At this time, the warehouse joined the original 4 storey spinning mill. 

For nearly 30 years, the mill was able to take in bales of raw cotton, spin them into yarn, and weave that into fabric.

By 1882 it was obvious that spinning was being done more effectively elsewhere. The real money was in weaving. 

The spinning mill was demolished, its stone going to make the 'new' weaving shed which still stands today.
