# Main Building - the Warehouse

This part of the mill was built around 1856 as a 3 storey warehouse, to support the North weaving shed next door, to the right.

It also housed the offices and dealt with inspection and despatch of the final product.

At this time, the warehouse joined the original 4 storey spinning mill. 

For nearly 30 years, the mill was able to take in bales of raw cotton, spin them into yarn, and weave that into fabric.

By 1882 it was obvious that spinning was being done more effectively elsewhere. The real money was in weaving. 

The spinning mill was demolished, its stone going to make the South weaving shed. The warehouse remained and the mill ran until 1971.

For over 20 years, the building languished, unoccupied and unmaintained until 1994. A demolition request was made.

Heritage Trust for the North West recognised the plight of the mill and intervened. It worked with local supporters, painstakingly researching to unearth its history and prove its importance.

In 1995 came the first success; the mill was Grade II listed. In 1999 Heritage Trust for the North West bought Higherford Mill with a loan from the Architectural Heritage Fund.

As a registered Building Preservation Trust, the Trust aims to find appropriate and sustainable new uses for old buildings. Its vision was for the Mill to become a focal point for the Creative Industries in East Lancashire. 

By 2009, offices, creative industries workshops and studios had been constructed and let, providing much needed facilities for artists, artisans as well as opportunities for local employment. 

Rents from the studios now pay for the upkeep of the Mill. More developments are coming, including the return of the waterwheel amd sustainable hydro- and solar power.
