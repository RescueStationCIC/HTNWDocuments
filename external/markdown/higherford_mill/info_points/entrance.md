Higherford Mill has a complex history and some unique features.

Over it's lifetime, it's changed many times to keep up with the demands of its customers and competitors.

It began by spinning yarn for local handloom weavers, and finished employing their great-grandchildren as powerloom weavers. It was one of the very first with a purpose-built saw-tooth roofline for better natural light. It adopted different power sources from water to coal and then diesel-electric. 

Ultimately though, the decline of the British textile industry proved fatal and Higherford Mill wove-out in 1971.

For over 20 years, the building languished, unoccupied and unmaintained until 1994. A demolition request was made.

Heritage Trust for the North West recognised the plight of the mill and intervened. It worked with local supporters, painstakingly researching to unearth its history and prove its importance.

In 1995 came the first success; the mill was Grade II listed - and in 1999 Heritage Trust for the North West bought Higherford Mill with a loan from the Architectural Heritage Fund.

As a registered Building Preservation Trust, the Trust aims to find appropriate and sustainable new uses for old buildings. Its vision was for the mill to become a focal point for the creative industries in East Lancashire. 

By 2009, offices, creative industries workshops and studios had been constructed and let, providing facilities for artists and artisans as well as opportunities for local employment. Rents from the studios now pay for the upkeep of the Mill. 

More developments are coming, including the return of the waterwheel and sustainable hydro- and solar power.
