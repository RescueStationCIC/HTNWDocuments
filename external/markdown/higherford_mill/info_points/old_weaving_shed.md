# 'Old' North Weaving Shed

This shed was built sometime around 1849 and marked Higherford Mill's push into weaving fabric at a grand scale.

The main warehouse building which you can see from across the river hadn't yet been built, so the shed housed around 160 looms, and did all its own storage, inspection and despatch.
When the main warehouse was built it could operate at its full capacity - over 214 looms.

The mill has always used a combination of power sources. Two drive shafts came into the building - one from the mill's steam engine, and one from the waterwheel. A special device called a Dog Clutch was used to combine the two into a single drive to power all the looms.

Loom operators needed lots of light to see by. Windows in the roof are north-facing to get the most out of any available sunlight. From the side, the roof has a 'saw-tooth' profile, familiar from factories everywhere. 

But this one is special. It's the oldest. The earliest surviving north-light structure in the world. Right here.
