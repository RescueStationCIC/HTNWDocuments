# Despatch Door

These huge doors lead into the mill's despatch area, where finished fabric was loaded onto waggons for distribution mostly for further processing, like printing.
The building was built in 1856 as a 3 storey warehouse, to support the North weaving shed next door, to the right. It also housed the offices and dealt with inspection and packing of the final product.
