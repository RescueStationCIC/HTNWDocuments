# Despatch Door

These huge doors lead into the mill's despatch area, where finished fabric was loaded onto wagons for distribution mostly for further processing, like printing.
This building was built in 1856 as a 3 storey warehouse, joining the 4 storey spinning mill which used to be next door to the left and a North weaving shed next door, to the right. 

Grimshaws built the warehouse to respond to new demands for the quality and amount of fabric it supplied.

It was a period of fantastic expansion for the mill and the textile industry in Lancashire. These doors will have seen a huge increase in traffic out onto the turnpike, as the Grimshaw's business boomed.

The mill has always been easily reached by transport.   
As it was built, in 1824 the turnpike road was doing good business and goods could be taken by wagon along it to the towns of Skipton and Clitheroe.   
The canal was just a half-mile away, at Barrowford and was already providing a link to Manchester, but also Blackburn, Leeds and Liverpool.    
From 1849 the East Lancashire Railway could be reached from nearby Colne, with connections to Blackburn, Preston, Manchester and Liverpool.  
But Christopher Grimshaw (owner of the mill at this time) liked to ride his horse to meetings in Manchester every week.

For nearly 30 years, the mill had the full capability: to take in bales of raw cotton, spin it into yarn, and weave that into fabric. 

Later, the Grimshaw's would respond again to different demands.
