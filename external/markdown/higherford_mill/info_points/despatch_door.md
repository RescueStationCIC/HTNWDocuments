# Despatch Door

These huge doors lead into the mill's despatch area, where finished fabric was loaded onto waggons for distribution mostly for further processing, like printing.
The building was built in 1856 as a 3 storey warehouse, to support the North weaving shed next door, to the right. It also housed the offices and dealt with inspection and packing of the final product. 
At this time, the warehouse joined the original 4 storey spinning mill. 
For nearly 30 years, the mill was able to take in bales of raw cotton, spin them into yarn, and weave that into fabric.

It was a period of fantastic expansion for the mill and the textile industry in Lancashire. 

These doors will have seen a huge increase in traffic out onto the turnpike, as the Grimshaw's business boomed.
