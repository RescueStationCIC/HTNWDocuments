# Handloom weavers' houses

At the start of the 1800s, handloom weavering was skilled work. Weavers worked in their houses in small communities in Lancashire.  

By 1820, there were over 170,000 handloom weavers in Lancashire, using this work to supplement whatever other income they had - mostly farming.

Working at home like this suited them, especially in winter; roads were mostly mud, so they couldn't travel far to work every day. Weaving cotton needs humid conditions, so most people worked in their cellars. It wasn't the best work-from-home deal, but people could work largely when they wanted to.

The Grimshaw family employed hundreds - putting-out work, supplying yarn and collecting the finished product - narrow strips of fabric, mostly Calico, 50 yards long (nearly 46m).

Grimshaw would send the fabric on to printers in towns like Clitheroe and Catterall, before selling to manufacturers.

But from 1832 the situation in Barrowford got uncomfortable and then progressivley worse as the Grimshaws diversified from spinning yarn and started weaving on power looms themselves. It required relatively unskilled workers, paid less, and gave more consistent quality in the fabric.

For the handloom weavers living nearby, it made for unpleasant competiton; although Grimshaw's still used 400 of them for putting-out contract work they couldn't hope to match the quality and price of the fabric made by the powerlooms. 

The boom in the textile industry over the next 30 years made sure there were plenty of jobs. Sooner or later, the handloom weavers packed up and moved to the factory. The change in their way of life was difficult. The mill insisted on 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, made worse by the demand that they work for no pay while being trained. 

By 1885, the mill had nearly 500 powerlooms. Handloomers were largely extinct.
