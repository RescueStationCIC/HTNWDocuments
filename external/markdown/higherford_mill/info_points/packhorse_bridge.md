# Packhorse Bridge

Known as the 'Old Bridge', it crosses Pendle Water and sits on the old packhorse track between Colne and Pendle Forest.  

It was built in the late 1500s but it took until 1815 to get its side walls. Pack horses carried their cargo in packs on their sides, called paniers. Bridges with sides would get them stuck!  

The sides went on as packhorse transport dwindled and the bridge changed in its use. 

The new bridge downstream was built to take the new turnpike road. You had to pay, but it offered a much better option than a muddy track. Carts could be used, which held much more cargo.
