# Workers' staircase

This staircase has been here since this warehouse building was built in 1856, just next to the spinning mill.
Until 1882, this was the way the spinners went in the morning and left in the evening. After that, no more spinners - the whole mill was demolished and replaced with a weaving shed.

The stairs' treads are worn from years of steps - when the first set of treads wore out, another set were simply nailed on top. 


# How did they work?

# Spinning - from 1824 to 1832
Grimsshaw's opeate a 4 story spinning mill, powered by waterwheel at first - they added a beam engine later.

Bales of cotton are brought in and stored until needed.

They are broken up, blended and 'scutched', removing seeds and leftover bits of the cotton plant.

This makes rolls of clean cotton wool, called a 'lap'.

***First Floor:***

Here's where you'll find the 'carding' machines. They perform a combing operation on the cotton, aligning the fibres, so they make a strong thread when spun.
This makes soft weak ropes of cotton fibre, called 'slivers', which are coiled up into cans to protect them.

***Second Floor:***

Cans of sliver are delivered to drawing frames, which combine several slivers into one.  The new sliver has a very regular thickness, with the fibres lying parallel to each other. 

Then there's *roving*, which reduces slivers to about 1/8 of their orignal diameter, pulling and twisiting it slightly, so it's strong enough to be wound onto a bobbin, ready for spinning.

In the back there were also two storeys available for handlooms, so the Grimshaws were employing weavers on-site, as well as simply spinning.
