# Workers' staircase

This staircase has been here since this warehouse building was built, just next to the spinning mill.
This was the way the spinners went in the morning and left in the evening. 
The stairs' treads are worn from years of steps - first in clogs, then in boots and finally shoes.
When the first set of treads wore out, another set were simply nailed on top. Now they have worn-down too.
