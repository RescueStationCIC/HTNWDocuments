# 'New' South Weaving Shed
This door used to lead to the South weaving shed. It was partly demolished in 1971, to make the forecourt outside, but most still remains as workshop units.

In 1882 Higherford Mill went full-on weaving. Previously, it had spun its own cotton, but as larger spinning mills were developed, it was cheaper to buy-in yarn from elsewhere.

The Wisemans - the proprietors at that time - built their new weaving shed by tearing down the 4 storey spinning mill and using its materials. 

It happended quickly, too. In just 3 years - by 1885 - the mill was weaving on 495 looms, up from 200.
