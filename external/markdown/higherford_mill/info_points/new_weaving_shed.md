# 'New' South Weaving Shed

In 1882 Higherford Mill went full-on weaving. Previously, it had spun its own cotton, but as larger spinning mills were developed, it was cheaper to buy-in yarn from elsewhere.

The 4 storey spinning mill was demolished and its materials used to build this new south shed for more looms.

It happended quickly, too. By 1885, the mill was weaving on 495 looms, up from 200 just 5 years before.

This needed more power! The mill used several new technologies to achive this. 

Hard to belive, but water-wheel technology had plenty of innovations still to go. A new water-wheel was added. Huge: 26ft high and 9ft wide. (That's nearly 8m high and 3m wide). Metal, with 'ventilated buckets'. It added 24% more power. That's a massive increase.

The mill's beam engine - used to supplement and regulate power from the water-wheel - was upgraded to provide more power, with a higher pressure boiler and another cylinder. It would have provided an impressive 220 horse-power. That's about the same as a mid range sports car.
