# Workshop and Gallery Space

This is the North weaving shed. 

When Heritage Trust for the North West rescued the mill, it was vital that it found another purpose - one which would sustain it and its community. 

This area provides a perfect space for local artists to create and show their work. The north lights above provide excellent conditions to enjoy an exhibition. 

Here, you'll find work by fine artists, ceramicists, jewellers and artisans in leather, wood, paper and of course, textile.
