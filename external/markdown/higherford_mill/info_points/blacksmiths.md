# Blacksmiths

All mills had to be self-sufficient. These were the days before there were any light-engineering factories around. A Blacksmith's is essential to rustle-up basic parts needed for repair.

This building would have had its own water-wheel, powering the bellows for a forge, hammer, drill and possibly a lathe. 

It looks to have been built in around 1849, relocating, because the land was needed for the North weaving shed.
