# Hoist
Here's the lift by which the product is taken to the seperate floors during its processing. Each floor does something different. 
Don't forget that Higherford Mill has changed many times in it's history:

## Spinning - from 1824 to 1832
Grimsshaw's operate a 4 story spinning mill, powered by waterwheel at first - they added a beam engine later.  
The cotton 'product' is loaded onto a trolley and taken to a hoist to be transported to the next floor.

### Ground Floor
Bales of cotton are brought in and stored until needed.

They are broken up, blended and 'scutched', removing seeds and leftover bits of the cotton plant.
This makes rolls of clean cotton wool, called a 'lap'. Very heavy.

### First Floor

Here's where you'll find the 'carding' machines. They perform a combing operation on the cotton, aligning the fibres, so they make a strong thread when spun.
This makes soft weak ropes of cotton fibre, called 'slivers', which are coiled up into cans to protect them.
Carding machines were dangerous: unwary workers sometimes lost fingers or arms in their crushing grip.

### Second Floor

Cans of sliver are delivered to drawing frames, which combine many slivers into one.  The new sliver has a very regular thickness, with the fibres lying parallel to each other. 
Roving frames reduce slivers to about 1/8 of their orignal diameter, pulling and twisiting it slightly, so it's strong enough to be wound onto a bobbin, ready for spinning.

### Third Floor

Bobbins are delivered to Throstle frames, which spin the roving into yarn. 
They're call Throstles, because they make a noise like a song thrush - if the song thrush was 8 feet tall and weighed the same as a family car.

In the back there were also two storeys available for handlooms, so the Grimshaws were employing weavers on-site, as well as simply spinning.
