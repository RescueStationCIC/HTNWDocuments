# Hoist
Here's the lift by which the product is taken to the seperate floors during its processing. Each floor does something different. 
Don't forget that Higherford Mill has changed many times in it's history:

## Spinning - from 1824 to 1832
Grimsshaw's operate a 4 story spinning mill, powered by waterwheel.
The cotton 'product' is loaded onto a trolley and taken to a hoist to be transported to the next floor.

### Ground Floor
Bales of cotton are brought in and stored until needed.

They are broken up, blended and 'scutched', removing seeds and leftover bits of the cotton plant.
This makes rolls of clean cotton wool, called a 'lap'. Very heavy.

### First Floor

Here's where you'll find the 'carding' machines. They perform a combing operation on the cotton, aligning the fibres, so they make a strong thread when spun.
This makes soft weak ropes of cotton fibre, called 'slivers', which are coiled up into cans to protect them.
Carding machines were dangerous: unwary workers sometimes lost fingers or arms in their crushing grip.

### Second Floor

Cans of sliver are delivered to drawing frames, which combine many slivers into one.  The new sliver has a very regular thickness, with the fibres lying parallel to each other. 
Roving frames reduce slivers to about 1/8 of their orignal diameter, pulling and twisiting it slightly, so it's strong enough to be wound onto a bobbin, ready for spinning.

### Third Floor

Bobbins are delivered to Throstle frames, which spin the roving into yarn. 
They're call Throstles, because they make a noise like a song thrush - if the song thrush was 8 feet tall and weighed the same as a family car.

### Outbuilding
An outbuilding on the south side of the mill had two storeys. Grimshaws hired handloom weavers, working on Dandy looms. This was additional to the community of handloom weavers in the village. The mill would supply them with its own yarn.


## Spinning and weaving - 1832 - 1848
In 1832, the Grimshaws cleared out the handloom weavers from the outbuilding and installed 74 powerlooms instead. For this, they needed the power of a beam engine. The Grimshaws were certainly on top of their game, here; Higherford Mill is one of the earliest mills using powerlooms, and certainly the first in the area to use steam power.

## Spinning and Weaving - 1849 - 1851
The North weaving shed is completed. It's pretty clear there's no love lost between the Grimshaws and the handloom weavers they displaced: the weaving shed is in an L-shape because the cottages couldn't be demolished to make way. 
The hoist would have been used to take finished yarn down to be woven. At least a quarter of the North shed would be taken up with peparing the yarn before weaving, and then inspecting and packaging the woven fabric for despatch.
